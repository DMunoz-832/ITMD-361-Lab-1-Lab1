		<h1>Hey, I'm Daniela Munoz</h1>
		<p>It's been a hot minute since I've touched on HTML and all its little additions. </p>
		<br>
		<p>As a first-year ITM major, I make sure to practice and get the hang of multiple programming languages without confusing them... which has happened a little too often. 
		<br>Hence, I need to start mastering some of them. I am currently working with a little bit of blue team hacking to see if its a viable career path for me. 
		<br>Other than that I bike a lot whenever the weather is decent.</p>
